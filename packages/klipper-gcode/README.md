# `klipper-gcode` Grammar

This project generates the TextMate grammar for Klipper-flavored GCode with
interpolated Jinja2/Python expressions (see also the `klipper-script` project).
This grammar is embedded in `gcode:` blocks in `klipper-cfg` files, and can also
be used to highlight standalone GCode files.
