# `klipper-cfg` Grammar

This project generates the TextMate grammar for Klipper configuration files.
It's the primary entry-point for the other grammars in this repository,
embedding the `klipper-gcode` grammar within `gcode:` blocks and the
`klipper-script` grammar within curly-brace-delimited template expressions.
